# Romanization of Hiragana

For this exercise, we'll convert hiragana to romanji. For instance, "ひらがな" becomes "hiragana".

There are many different ways to romanize hiragana. For the exercise, we'll use the [Nihon-shiki system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-shiki_romanization), as it is the most regular.

To get you started, there is a test harness you can run with `ruby test/test_romanize.rb`.
